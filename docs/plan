For this project, I plan on creating several simple methods that can be called depending on input.
The four methods will be 'create', 'turn_on', 'turn_off' and 'switch'.
'create' will take the first line of the input (a number > 0 and > 1000) and create a grid with coordinates (x,y)
the other 3 methods will take subsequent lines of input. These lines will need to be separated and saved to appropriate variables to call a particular function and feed two sets of coordinates in as parameters.
One potential issue may be separating out the function call from input, as in two cases it is two words, and the other only one.
